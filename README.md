# [Racepack] Holliday Races - Version: (1.0.0B)
This is an easy-to-install race package for Tha Pwned's version of the Warcraft-Source modification which can be found and downloaded [here](https://github.com/ThaPwned/WCS).


## Requirements
For this package to work, it is required that you first install the following:
- [EventScripts-Emulator](https://github.com/Ayuto/EventScripts-Emulator)
- [Warcraft-Source](https://github.com/ThaPwned/WCS)
- [Warcraft-Source: Essentials](https://github.com/ManifestManah/Warcraft-Source-Essentials)


## What does this package do? - And what does it contain?
Installing this package on to your server will add 17 new races to your Warcraft-Source server.
All of the 17 races are remastered/reworked versions of Holliday's races. Unlike the previously released Holliday races & racepacks this one will not cause your server to occassionally crash. I'd recommend this package to any server owner due to it's nostalgia. The pack contains races that brought a lot of joy to both community and players alike.


**List of races:**
- Athena
- Beast
- Blood Demon
- Die Xonvert
- Eye Ra
- Genocide
- Jack
- Molecule
- Nebula
- Ozzmosis
- Panorama
- Rapscallion
- Reptile
- Scorpion
- Hell Sloth
- Spiderman
- Vagabond


## Step-by-step installation guide
- Go to your csgo or cstrike directory (NOTE! Some servers name this directory the server's IP instead).
- Drag and drop the two folders named: "cfg" and "addons" in to the directory.
- Now go to csgo/cfg find and open the file named: "autoexec.cfg".
- Add the following line: ```es_load wcs/loaders/racepack_holliday``` to the file, save it, and close the file.
- Go to csgo/cfg/source-python/wcs/ and open the file named: ```Racepack Holliday - (Version 1.0.0B).ini```.
- Copy all the text and paste it in your races.ini file and restart your the server.
- NOTE! If you don't have a races.ini file already, then just change the name of the file from ```Racepack Holliday - (Version 1.0.0B).ini``` to ```races.ini``` and then restart your server.
